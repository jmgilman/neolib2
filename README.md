Neolib2
=======

This is an overhaul of the original Neolib python library which provided an object based framework for automating the popular browser based game, Neopets. This second revision has the same core mission but takes an updated approach by:

- Increasing overall speed of the library by switching the main parsing engine to lxml
- Implementing a core base class to support a more uniform library
- Being written with Python 3 from scratch
- Focusing on a cloud based approach rather than expecting the end-user to be using a graphical interface.

The project is currently in early development and many things will break in the future. For more information about the current objects found in the class, the most up to date documentation can be found here: http://neolib2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
